# Week 6

## What I did

This week I spent most of the time running performance tests, as it was really slow with high AI thinking times. I also made my own bare-bones "AIArrayList" data structure, so now my AI uses only my own data structures.

## Problems and questions

All good!

## Next up

The course is about to end, so I will finish my documentation for the final deadline and polish the application for the demo meeting.

#### Time spent this week: 15 hours
