The goal of the project is to create a Java program that is capable of playing the popular card game called Rummy against both itself and human players.

## Algorithms and data structures

The program will probably use some sort of a probablility algorithm to calculate the odds for each card to be in an enemy's hand or in the deck. The probablility values could be stored in a two-dimensional array where they are updated when necessary. I don't yet know what kind of a decision making algorithm should be used that would make use of the probability values and decide what to do in the game.
