# Week 5

## What I did

This week I focused on doing unit tests. The code coverage is now pretty decent. I also did a lot of refactoring and fixed a game breaking bug.

## Problems and questions

All good!

## Next up

Next week I will focus on doing documentation.

#### Time spent this week: 15 hours
