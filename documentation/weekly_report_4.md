# Week 4

## What I did

I spent this week almost exclusively finishing and debugging the AI. The tree search would crash unexpectedly in certain weird scenarios and solving that took almost all of the time I had this week. Now the AI works without crashing. I also added some more comments into my code and did some tests.

## Problems and questions

All seems good!

## Next up

My AI has still at least one nasty bug that makes it play pretty bad. Next week I will try to solve that, then do a *lot* of testing. And also I will finally add Checkstyle and Javadocs.

#### Time spent this week: 25 hours
