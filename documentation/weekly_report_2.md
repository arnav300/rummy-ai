# Week 2

## What I did

This week I coded the game and learned about Monte Carlo tree search. Sadly I did not get to start the AI this week as supposed, because I underestimated the amount of work it took to code the game itself.

## Problems and questions

I am not sure if I should use Information Set Monte Carlo tree search or just normal Monte Carlo tree search. I don't fully understand how the ISMCTS is implemented in practice, so I will have to look into that.

My question is, do I have to write unit tests for the game too or just the AI? Also, what about the "own data structure implementations"? Am I correct to assume I have to do that only for the AI and not the game itself as that would take forever?

## Next up

The game is now pretty much ready so that next week I can start doing the AI itself. I will have to read code examples about the algorithms and completely understand how they work. They seem to be quite similiar, so I can just start doing one and then switch if needed.

#### Time spent this week: 28 hours
