# Week 2

## What I did

This week I coded the game and learned about Monte Carlo tree search. Sadly I did not get to start the AI this week as supposed, because I underestimated the amount of work it took to code the game itself.

## Problems and questions

I'm having some problems with understanding how the Information Set Monte Carlo tree search works in practice, but I think I will learn that by studying code examples in GitHub. So the question is, do I have to write unit tests for the game too or just the AI? Also, what about the "own data structure implementations"? Am I correct to assume I don't have to do that for the game itself as that would take forever?

## Next up

The game is now pretty much ready so that next week I can start doing the AI itself. I will have to read code examples about the algorithm and completely understand how it works.

#### Time spent this week: 28 hours
