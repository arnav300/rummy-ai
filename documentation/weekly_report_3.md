# Week 3

## What I did

This week I spent a lot of time doing JUnit tests. I also restructured my application so now different kinds of classes are separated into different packages. Additionally I did some methods for my upcoming AI, and some general refactoring.

## Problems and questions

While doing my tests this week, for some reason I could not generate Jacoco test reports with Gradle, even when modifying my build.gradle like in the example "Testing-and-rmq" build.gradle file. It says "Unable to read execution data file .../build/jacoco/test.exec" and I don't yet know how to resolve the issue.

## Next up

Next week I will try my best to finish my AI. I have a pretty good plan for it so I believe it will be finished if I can just find enough time for it. Also, I should create Javadocs for my classes and methods.

#### Time spent this week: 18 hours
