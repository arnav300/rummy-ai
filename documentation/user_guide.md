# User guide

## Running the application

This program uses Java to run. You will need to have Java 8 or newer installed. Download the latest rummy-ai.jar release, then run that with the command *java -jar rummy-ai.jar*

## Using the application

When you run the program, it will ask you which game mode you want to play. The game modes are as follows:

1. AI vs player game. This is the default game mode where you will play against the AI. You can choose a difficulty level for the AI.
2. AI vs AI game. Here you can spectate a game where two AI's will play against each other. You can choose the difficulty levels for both AI's seperately.
3. Player vs player game. This game mode is not actually suitable for playing against another human player. It is still a good way to learn how the game actually works. 
4. Performance tests. You can run these to test the speed and the win rate of the different AI levels. Performance tests can take a very long time to run if you choose high level AIs, so use with caution.
