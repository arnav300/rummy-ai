# Testing

Unit tests for the Java application have been done using JUnit. Unit testing of the application so far is not very good, however, a lot of manual testing has been done to make sure the application functions properly. More unit tests will be added in the coming days.

According to the first performance tests, the AI does up to 10 000 game simulations in a second, which is way more than I had anticipated. More extensive performance tests will also be added shortly.
