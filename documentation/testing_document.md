# Testing

Unit tests for the Java application have been done using JUnit. You can view the latest Jacoco test report [here](https://nakkekakke.github.io/rummy-ai/index/). 

Unit testing of the application is starting to look pretty decent with line coverage being over 80%, however I will be adding some more unit tests in the future. Also, a lot of manual testing has been done to make sure the application functions properly.


According to the first performance tests, the AI does up to 10 000 game simulations in a second, which is way more than I had anticipated. More extensive performance tests will also be added shortly.
