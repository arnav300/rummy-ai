# Week 1

## What I did

This week I decided what kind of program I am going to do. I have set up the project repository, done the initial definition document and tried to search information and tips on what kind of algorithms to use.

## Problems and questions

I am not sure what kind of a decision making algorithm would be good for a card game like this. Some algorithm that considers the probablilities of cards being in enemy's hand, but how? Maybe with some kind of a tree or graph structure? I am quite new to this AI stuff, having only done some very simple things before, so I don't really know which algorithms to even consider here.

## Next up

Next week I will create the game itself that will later be played by the AI. Also probably going to ask for help with the problems, and start implementing some parts of the AI into the game.
